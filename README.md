# How I Finally Stopped Overthinking My Short Videos and Started Creating Faster  

### The struggle of making short content  
I’ve been making short videos for a while now — mostly tutorials, little creative edits, and some random “talking to the camera” stuff. I love the process, but sometimes it feels like my brain gets stuck before I even start. The idea is there, but turning it into something people actually want to watch in under 60 seconds? That’s the hard part.  

Editing used to be the longest part of my process. I’d sit for hours cutting clips, syncing captions, and choosing background music that didn’t sound like it came from 2012. It’s fun, but it’s also draining.

### When I started exploring smarter workflows  
At some point, I started looking into different tools to help me speed things up. I tried templates, auto-captioning apps, even online editors that promised “instant magic.” Most of them helped a little, but I still felt like I was doing too much manual work.  

That’s when I came across something called [**AI Clip Maker**](https://www.short.ai/ai-clip-maker) — the name made me curious. I didn’t expect much, but I tried it out anyway. It was kind of surprising how it could take a longer piece of content and find the interesting parts for me. It wasn’t perfect, but it gave me a starting point. Suddenly, I wasn’t facing a blank screen anymore.

### Discovering what really saves time  
Over time, I realized that the real productivity boost doesn’t just come from editing faster — it’s from **thinking less about the repetitive parts**. The creative energy I saved could go into scripting better intros or improving delivery. I learned to trust automation a little more, even though it felt weird at first.  

There’s another tool I’ve been quietly testing for a few weeks called [**Short AI**](https://www.short.ai). It’s not something I want to hype up too much, but it fits into my workflow in a surprisingly natural way. It helps me focus on storytelling rather than trimming timelines. I guess that’s the real value of these newer AI tools: they don’t replace creativity, they just take care of the parts you don’t want to obsess over.

### A few lessons for other creators  
If you’re a short-form creator, here’s what I’ve learned:  
- Don’t aim for perfection on your first cut. Speed matters more than precision early on.  
- Find tools that match your style, not just what’s trending.  
- Let AI help, but keep your creative fingerprint.  

The biggest mindset shift for me was realizing that short videos are less about editing mastery and more about clear, engaging ideas. Once I stopped overcomplicating the process, making content actually became fun again.
